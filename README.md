# Adam Laycock

This repo is templated off of [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) and is the code for my personal website https://adamlaycock.ca

If you are trying to use this as a template for your own personal site through Obsidian, you will run into challenges when it comes to Obsidian's bases feature. Bases aren't supported by Quartz yet, so I had to fork [Quartz-syncer](https://github.com/alaycock/quartz-syncer) to shoehorn-in a customer renderer for bases. If you want to try out the Obsidian plugin, be sure to disable caching when publishing your vault, otherwise your bases will be out of date.

If you are exploring this repo from a code-quality perspective, keep in mind that this is built off of a template and I haven't put in much effort to keep things tidy, eg, no linting or prettier. Maybe someday, but I'm currently prioritizing function over form!

## Environment Variables

This project uses the Strava API to get GPX routes and Maps for trips on Strava. See STRAVA_SETUP.md for more setup details.

Additionally, this project uses Mapbox to render maps. You can create a Mapbox token here: https://account.mapbox.com/access-tokens

Once you have all those details, create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:

```bash
# Strava API Configuration
STRAVA_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
STRAVA_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
STRAVA_BOOTSTRAP_REFRESH_TOKEN=your_bootstrap_refresh_token_here

# Mapbox Configuration (for maps)
MAPBOX_TOKEN=your_mapbox_token_here
```
